How do I configure a Discord bot for Spidermon?
===============================================

What are bots?
--------------

A bot is a type of Discord user designed to interact with users via conversation.

To work with :doc:`Discord Actions </actions/discord-action>`,
you will need a Discord webhook which would send notifications to Discord from Spidermon.

Steps
-----

#. Create a Discord webhook <https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook>`_.

#. Once your webhook is created, you will receive its URL. This is what we use for ``SPIDERMON_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL``.

#. Add your Discord bot credential to your Scrapy project's settings. That's it.

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    SPIDERMON_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
