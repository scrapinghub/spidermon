Discord action
===============

This action allows you to send custom messages to a `Discord`_ channel
using a bot when your monitor suites finish their execution.

To use this action you need to provide the `Discord webhook URL`_ in your ``settings.py`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    SPIDERMON_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL>"

A notification will look like the following:
